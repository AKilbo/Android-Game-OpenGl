#Basic Android Game
This repo contains code for a basic Android game.

##Folders
* 'game' contains the actual game.
* 'Eclipse Project' contains a basic Android app for the purposes of learning.

##TODO
* Investigate issues with screen orientation changes
* Investigate other state restoration things onStop
* Generalise the GamePanel class
* Seperate the game state from GamePanel?
* Consider a more elaborate Entity/Component model
* Do we want to use the Artemis library? (see:http://gamadu.com/artemis/)
* Mock up the 'dial' interaction
* Fleshout the basics of the game more
* Implement and RPG style background
* Some method to do more than just straight lines in particle system
* 
* Just putting a note here, we need to make the renderer only render on demand not continuously I will look into this
* It would probably be good to split the work between logic and rendering, I'm open to doing either
* When in doubt "I" in this doc refers to naxareth
