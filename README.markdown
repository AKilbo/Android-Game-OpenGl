#Basic Android Game
This repo contains code for a basic Android game.

##Folders
* 'game' contains the actual game.
* 'Eclipse Project' contains a basic Android app for the purposes of learning.

##TODO
* Investigate issues with screen orientation changes
* Investigate other state restoration things onStop
* Generalise the GamePanel class
* Seperate the game state from GamePanel?
* Consider a more elaborate Entity/Component model
* Mock up the 'dial' interaction
* Some method to do more than just straight lines in particle system
* 
* Added the OpenGL library to the game, discover how it can be implemented and how it can manage graphics we are looking for
* forked a seperate branch of the game to test this out with, not the main dev branch
